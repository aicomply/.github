# AI Compliance inc.

Many potential users of AI are held back by the worry that their project may not be compliant with current or future regulations. This can apply if you use AI in any part of your organisation. In the worst case you may have to abandon your AI project, or face fines or other penalties. This audit tool can be used to understand issues that may affect your plans.

You can purchase a digital audit, which uses Dynamic Knowledge Graph technology, to ask a series of questions to establish current and future compliance considerations for your application in a single jurisdiction.

Currently the tools support the USA, the EU and the UK as jurisdictions and AI Comply is working on adding more.

Unlike Generative AI-based technology, the Knowledge Graph operation is transparent, traceable and repeatable, and thus can ensure the reliability of the results and rapidly adapt to changes in compliance and AI technology.

The results of the audit will be presented on screen and as a downloadable PDF link.

## Coming soon
### Version 2

The next version of the AI Compliance bot will be free form, using NLP/LLM technology to comminicate with and interpret the user's interactions, but retaining a much larger Knowledge Graph to ensure that the information given is corrct and auditable.
Version 2 will cover all countries that currently have AI policies or regulations.
